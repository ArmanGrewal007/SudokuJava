# SudokuJava

## About
This is a simple Sudoku game built with [Java-11](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) and Swing's JFrames. 
The game is interactive, allowing players to enter digits into the grid and see if they are correct or not. 
The game also includes a backtracking algorithm that players can use to solve the puzzle if they get stuck. 
Additionally, there is a "New Game" button that generates a new minimal Sudoku puzzle with only one solution.

## Requirements
Java 11 or higher

## Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/ArmanGrewal/SudokuJava.git`
